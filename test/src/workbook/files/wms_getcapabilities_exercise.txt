To show the WMS GetCapabilities:

   #. Navigate to :menuselection:`Demo --> Demo Requests` page.

   #. Select the ``WMS_1.1.1_GetCapabilities.url`` request. The full request is reproduced below, with line breaks added for clarity::

        http://localhost:8080/geoserver/wms?
          service=wms&
          version=1.1.1&
          request=GetCapabilities

      The server endpoint, ``service``, and ``version`` are all the same as we have seen before. The only difference is the ``request``, which is ``GetCapabilities``. There are no other parameters needed.
  
   #. Click :guilabel:`Submit`.
